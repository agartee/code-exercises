# Code Exercises

Welcome to our series of computer programming exercises designed to sharpen your coding skills and introduce you to the world of test-driven development (TDD). Whether you're just starting your journey into programming or looking to enhance your existing skills, these exercises are tailored to provide you with a comprehensive learning experience.

Test-driven development is a powerful software development process that encourages simple designs and inspires confidence. By writing tests before your actual code, you not only clarify your goals but also ensure that your code meets those objectives from the start. This approach leads to more reliable, bug-free software and a deeper understanding of the code you write.

Our exercises range from basic concepts to more complex scenarios, allowing you to gradually build your knowledge and apply TDD principles effectively. Each exercise is designed to challenge you, encouraging problem-solving and critical thinking in a real-world coding environment.

As you progress through these exercises, remember that the journey of learning to code is as important as the destination. Take your time, understand the principles behind each task, and don't be afraid to refactor your code as you learn new things. Test-driven development is not just a skill but a mindset that will serve you well throughout your coding career.

Below, you will find links to a variety of exercises. Start where you feel comfortable, and don't hesitate to revisit earlier exercises as you grow. Happy coding, and welcome to the exciting world of test-driven development!
